												<h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">What do I do now?!</h5>
												<p>
													Congratulations for reaching max level! This is where the real fun starts! This guide will teach you what you should do after reaching level 175.
												</p>
												<p>
													Firstly, I would suggest trying to get your 175 Equipment.
													Either buy the Armor Parts and Weapon from players, shouldn't be too expensive unless you are a raider, or find a team to run Goldflower Temple.
													Once you have your full set and weapon, begin upgrading it. Level 175 Equipment uses the new exclusive <a href="/guide/everpower">Everpower Upgrade System</a>.
													The Everpower Upgrade system requires <img class="mx-1" src="/images/Icons/Itm_SysShredsOfPower.png">Shreds of Power, and some form of <img class="mx-1" src="/images/Icons/Itm_SysEverdust.png">Everdust.
													To obtain Shreds of Power you must go to Frostwind and kill the giants there. They drop Shreds of Power and <img class="mx-1" src="/images/Icons/Itm_SysCraftAstralPowder.png">Astral Powder. Astral Powder is used in crafting Insignias and I will get into that soon.
													There are 4 different versions of Everdust. Everdust is used to upgrade 175 Equipment from +0 to +10. Arcane Everdust is used to upgrade 175 Equipment from +11 to +20. Ethereal Everdust gives a better success rate than both Everdust an Arcane Everdust and can be used from +0 to +20. Divine Everdust has the highest success rate and can also be used from +0 to +20.
													Everdust and Arcane Everdust can be obtained in 3 dungeons: Hillid Mountains, Icy Caverns, and Temple of Catan. Hillid Mountains and Icy Caverns are mainly where you obtain all the materials for Everpower Upgrading. Temple of Catan also drops the materials, but in a lower quantity.
													Read the <a href="/guide/everpower">Everpower Upgrade Guide</a> to learn more about it.
												</p>
												<p>
													Farming Hillid Mountains and Icy Caverns every day may seem rough at first, but it will get better with time. Everyone starts out somewhere. Make sure you run them 3 times each every day. The Dungeon Entries reset at 00:00 Server Time.
													You can see your remaining Dungeon Entries by pressing 'H'. Another dungeon to run every day is Colosseum. It has an easy and hard mode. This dungeon has 4 entries per day, and is mainly farmed for the <img class="mx-1" src="/images/Icons/Itm_SysPowerbinds.png"> Powerbinds. Powerbinds are explained in further detailed in the Everpower Guide.
													You can start seeing a trend already. There are plenty of dungeons to run by yourself every day. Players call these "Dailies". After running all your dailies you should get about 10-15p per day from just the penya loot. That adds up quickly and gives you some money to upgrade with.
												</p>
												<p>
													You may be wondering, "I know how to obtain 175 Equipment, but what Accessories can I obtain?" There are the Accessories that drop from Giants and World Bosses, and there are the endgame jewelry that you can craft. They are called Onima Accessories. There are three tiers of Onima Accessories.
													The <a href="/guide/crafting">Crafting Guide</a> has a list of the materials required to craft each piece. You can go to the Crafting NPC [Crafting] Ugoki in Central Flarine to open the Crafting Menu and see the exact recipes.
													Onima's Cave drops the materials for Onima Accesories. There is a Solo mode and a Team mode. The Solo mode drops a lesser quantity than the Team mode. Once you are strong enough you should start to run Solo Onima's Cave. Maybe if you're lucky, a team will invite you to the Team mode.
													Many players sell the materials at fairly inexpensive prices, so at first it may be faster to craft Onima Accesories by buying materials off of players.
													<br>
													In order to upgrade Onima Accesories you will need to use <img class="mx-1" src="/images/Icons/Itm_GenMatOrichalcum02.png">Shining Oricalkums and <img class="mx-1" src="/images/Icons/Itm_SysSysScrSmelprot4.png">Scrolls of AProtect. Shining Oricalkum can be farmed at Whimsical Forest. The Giants there drop them.
												</p>
												<p>
													Remember when I mentioned <img class="mx-1" src="/images/Icons/Itm_SysCraftAstralPowder.png">Astral Powder was used for crafting <img class="mx-1" src="/images/Icons/Item_SysAstrlGoddessInsignia02.png">Insignias? Well, I'll go into detail about that in this section. There are Tier 1 Insignias and Tier 2 Insignias. They are items that you insert into the 'H' window and they give you permanant stat bonuses. You can remove them but you cannot trade them. They are account bound once you insert them.
													Insignias are crafted using materials obtained from the dungeon Faymarsh Peak. Faymarsh Peak also has a Solo mode and a Team mode. The Solo mode gives 1/3 of the quantity of materials as the Team mode, so once you are strong enough to be accepted into Team runs, I suggest running this dungeon as a team as often as possible. If you cannot find a team in time before Dungeon Entry Reset time (00:00 Server Time), then go ahead and do the Solo mode.
													The <a href="/guide/crafting">Crafting Guide</a> has a list of the materials required to craft Insignias if you want to see for yourself. Each Tier 1 Insignia has the same recipe, and Tier 2 Insignias also have the same recipe.
